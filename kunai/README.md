# Kunai (WIP)

This is a simple service supporting analysis through [Kunai sandbox](https://kunai.rocks).
The current version is a Work-In-Progress with a very simple functionality and no
heuristics generated. By default, the public sandbox under https://sandbox.kunai.rocks/
is used - please note, all submissions there are public!

Currently:

* You can select desired sandbox.
* If the sample already exists and was successfully analyzed, the existing submission
  matching the sandbox will be used. You can also force resubmission.
* The execution graph and PCAP are downloaded.
